Arduino Uno is easiest to learn microcontroller board. You can connect it to computer via USB Cable and program it to Control Motors, LEDs, Sensors and ICs to make electronic projects like basic robots, line followers, robotic arm. For many, Arduino Uno is the first board to be used by electronics engineers when they start learning about microcontrollers.
